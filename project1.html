      <h2>The Dating App Crisis No One Wants to Talk About</h2>
      <p>
        Most dating platforms are built around instant visibility, where <strong>appearance drives first impressions</strong> and decision-making. This dynamic promotes <strong>superficial interactions, premature rejection, and performance anxiety.</strong> Users lack a structured way to build <strong>emotional connection</strong> before being fully seen. A new approach is needed — one that allows vulnerability to unfold gradually.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p>"Why does attraction have to start with appearance?"</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Goal Of UnMask</h2>
      <p>
        Create a dating experience that <strong>reduces appearance-based pressure</strong> and enables <strong>emotional connection</strong> to develop first.
      </p>

      <h2>Behavioral Observations</h2>
      <p>
          Across popular dating platforms, first impressions are heavily driven by 
         <strong>profile photos</strong>, encouraging rapid visual judgment before meaningful 
         interaction begins. I noticed recurring patterns of <strong>appearance pressure, 
         fast rejection cycles, and shallow early-stage conversations</strong> — many 
         interactions end before emotional connection has the chance to develop.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Process</h2>

    <p>
     I began by mapping the full user journey to ensure the staged reveal concept 
     was structurally sound before moving into visual design. The flow was designed 
     to feel <strong>natural and low-pressure</strong> at every decision point.
    </p>

      <!-- User Flow -->
      <div class="userflow-wrap">
        <img src="images/project1-userflow.jpg" alt="User flow diagram">
      </div>

      <p>
        The user flow maps the complete journey from onboarding to match. New users go through
        <strong>account setup and profile creation</strong> before reaching the Home Page, while
        existing users land directly. From there, users enter the <strong>Finding Match Screen</strong>
        where the staged reveal process begins — if both users agree to match, they progress through
        <strong>three interaction stages:</strong> a 5-minute voice call with a mask avatar, a masked
        video call, and finally a real face reveal. If either user opts out at any stage, they return
        to the Home Page to meet someone new. A successful reveal leads to the
        <strong>Matches Page</strong> where ongoing conversations continue.
      </p>

      <!-- Iteration -->
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Iteration</h3>

      <div class="image-grid">
        <div class="case-image">
          <img src="images/project1-iteration1.jpg" alt="Iteration before">
        </div>
        <div class="case-image">
          <img src="images/project1-iteration2.png" alt="Iteration after">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The login screen was redesigned to replace separate "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons with a
        streamlined form directly on screen, adding <strong>email/password fields</strong>,
        "Remember Me", "Forgot Password?" and a new user prompt for a more intuitive flow.
        The background colour was also shifted from a warm peach <strong>(#FFDBC7)</strong> to
        a soft lavender <strong>(#F3E9F7)</strong> to better reflect the app's
        <strong>romantic and mysterious tone</strong>, creating a calmer and more emotionally
        engaging atmosphere.
      </p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>

      <p>UnMask introduces a <strong>three-stage reveal system</strong> that replaces 
         appearance-first matching with progressive emotional connection — starting with 
         a masked voice call, building to a masked video call, and finally a 
         <strong>mutual face reveal</strong> only when both users agree.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
      Designing UnMask was my first full end-to-end app built independently. It pushed me to 
      think in <strong>systems rather than screens</strong> — ensuring each interaction stage 
      logically supported the concept of gradual vulnerability. I learned the importance of 
      aligning behavioral insight with structural design. In future iterations, I would conduct 
      <strong>early user validation</strong> to better understand how users respond to 
      progressive visibility.
